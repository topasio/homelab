# homelab-scripts
I like to use these scripts for my trainees (Fachinformatiker Systemintegration) to let them build a home lab and integrate and modify these scripts. This covers a lot:

- Basic Linux handling
- Basic Linux bash scripting
- Networking and port security
- SSH incl. key management
- VPN with Wireguard
- Basic monitoring and later installation of Zabbix
- Backup and restore

After implementation, it is a good exercise to talk about why some measures are not sufficient and how they can be improved (i.e. port scanning, status script).
